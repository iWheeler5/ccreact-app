      <p>
        Club Culture was founded out of a passion for both dance music and
        clubbing. It is a platform that connects those who share our passion,
        with the venues that fuel the UKâ€™s iconic clubbing culture. The platform
        highlights those clubs at the forefront of this, allowing users to rate
        and review over 120 of the best venues across the country. We aim to
        promote new clubbing experiences, assisting users in discovering
        exciting new venues and events in their own city and beyond.
